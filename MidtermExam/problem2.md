## Problem 2-5

Consider the code:

```python
L = [1,2,3]
d = {'a': 'b'}
def f(x):
    return 3
```

Which of the following does NOT cause an exception to be thrown?

1. print(L[3])
2. print(d['b'])
3. for i in range(100001, -1, -2): print(f)
4. print(int('abc))
5. None of the above

## Problem 2-6

Examine the following code snippet:

```python
stuff  = _____
for thing in stuff:
    if thing == 'iQ':
       print("Found it")
```

Select all the values of the variable "stuff" that will make the code print "Found it".

1. ["iBoy", "iGirl", "iQ", "iC","iPaid","iPad"]
2. ("iBoy", "iGirl", "iQ", "iC","iPaid","iPad")
3. [ ( "iBoy", "iGirl", "iQ", "iC","iPaid","iPad") ]
4. ( [ "iBoy", "iGirl", "iQ", "iC","iPaid","iPad" ], )
5. ["iQ"]
6. "iQ"

### Answer

> 1, 2 and 5

## Problem 2-7

The following Python code is supposed to compute the square of an integer by using successive additions.

```python
def Square(x):
    return SquareHelper(abs(x), abs(x))

def SquareHelper(n, x):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    return SquareHelper(n-1, x) + x
```

Not considering recursion depth limitations, what is wrong with this implementation of procedure Square? Check all that apply.

1. It is going to return a wrong value.
2. The term Square is a reserved Python keyword.
3. Function names cannot start with a capital letter.
4. The function is never going to return anything.
5. Python has arbitrary precision arithmetic.
6. This function will not work for negative numbers.
7. The call SquareHelper(abs(x), abs(x)) won't work because you can't have abs(x) as both parameters.
8. Nothing is wrong; the code is fine as-is.
