"""Problem Set 3, Problem 4 - The Game.

Now you will implement the function hangman, which takes one parameter - the secretWord the user is to guess.
This starts up an interactive game of Hangman between the user and the computer. Be sure you take advantage of
the three helper functions, isWordGuessed, getGuessedWord, and getAvailableLetters, that you've defined in the
previous part.

Hints:
You should start by noticing where we're using the provided functions (at the top of ps3_hangman.py) to load
the words and pick a random one. Note that the functions loadWords and chooseWord should only be used on your
local machine, not in the tutor. When you enter in your solution in the tutor, you only need to give your
hangman function.

Consider using lower() to convert user input to lower case. For example:
  guess = 'A'
  guessInLowerCase = guess.lower()

Consider writing additional helper functions if you need them!

There are four important pieces of information you may wish to store:
  1. secretWord: The word to guess.
  2. lettersGuessed: The letters that have been guessed so far.
  3. mistakesMade: The number of incorrect guesses made so far.
  4. availableLetters: The letters that may still be guessed. Every time a player guesses a letter, the guessed
     letter must be removed from availableLetters (and if they guess a letter that is not in availableLetters, you
     should print a message telling them they've already guessed that - so try again!).

    * At the start of the game, let the user know how many

    * Ask the user to supply one guess (i.e. letter) per round.

    * The user should receive feedback immediately after each guess
      about whether their guess appears in the computers word.

    * After each round, you should also display to the user the
      partially guessed word so far, as well as letters that the
